Interactive Voltage and Current Animation with Matplotlib

Welcome to the Interactive Voltage and Current Animation repository! This Python script uses Matplotlib to create an animated plot showcasing voltage and current variations in a sinusoidal wave.

Features
Real-time Animation: Experience a dynamic animation of voltage and current fluctuations in response to a sinusoidal wave.
Interactive Input: Use the slider to adjust the voltage amplitude interactively.
Easy-to-Understand Plot: Two subplots display voltage and current over time, making it easy to analyze the waveforms.
Getting Started



Clone the Repository:

###############bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/InteractiveVoltageCurrentAnimation.git
cd InteractiveVoltageCurrentAnimation
Install Dependencies:

###############bash

pip install matplotlib numpy
Run the Script:

###############bash
python voltage_current_animation.py
Interact with the Animation:
Adjust the "Voltage Amplitude" slider and click "Start Animation" to see the live update.

Customization
Feel free to modify the script to experiment with different wave frequencies, colors, or plot styles. Your creativity is the limit!
